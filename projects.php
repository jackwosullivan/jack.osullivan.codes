            <p>
                I worked as a developer on a team which created a responsive website for Ostara Biomedical. I specialised in ensuring that all code was semantic.

            <p>
                I was the lead developer for the majority of the development of a website which is the Bright Future Software website. This project used a number of different technologies as a WordPress theme in a LAMP stack, the deployment of which I was solely charged with performing.
